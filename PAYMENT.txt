  Thank you for this very detailed overview, now I need clarity on a few things, especially on the payment requests and confirmation via webhook, I want to
  understand what do you mean here and how does this work? who is confirming etc

 Sure—here’s how the payment flow works in this prototype, and how it maps to a real-world integration.

  ### 1. Creating a payment request

  - When a buyer has an order ready (e.g., right from a product page or later in the Payments screen) they can hit the “Create mobile money request” button.
  - That simply calls our API (POST /api/payments/) and records a Payment object in the database with status pending. Think of this as telling LMGa’s system,
    “We’ve asked the PSP (e.g., M-Pesa, Tigo Pesa) to charge the buyer.”

  ### 2. Waiting for confirmation

  - In production, the PSP/mobile-money gateway would do the actual charging (e.g., push a prompt to the buyer’s phone) and, once the transaction settles,
    call back to LMGa’s webhook endpoint (/api/webhooks/payments/) with the result.
  - The webhook is how the PSP says “this payment succeeded” (or failed). LMGa’s backend updates the stored Payment to success or failed and, if successful,
    marks the order as confirmed.

  ### 3. Confirming in the prototype

  - Because we’re not actually integrated with a PSP yet, the UI gives you a “Trigger success webhook” button. That just sends a sample JSON payload to /api/
    webhooks/payments/.
  - The backend treats it exactly like a PSP notification: finds the payment by its tx_ref, updates its status, and (if success) moves the order to
    “confirmed”. So for now you are the “PSP” when you press that button—this is purely a simulator.

  ### What would happen in production

  - LMGa would pass the real payment request to the PSP (usually via an API call), log the Payment object, and wait.
  - The PSP handles customer authentication/charging and calls back to /api/webhooks/payments/ with their official payload.
  - LMGa’s backend would validate the payload (signature, hash, etc.), update the payment/order, and optionally notify users.

  So the “confirmation via webhook” simply means “we accept the PSP’s transaction result from their callback endpoint.” Right now we simulate it from the UI
  to keep the loop fully demonstrable without a real PSP contract.

  Let me know if you want to see the exact payloads or tweak the flow to match a specific mobile money provider.
