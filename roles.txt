So since you mentioned that LMGa are handling tracking, testing, and coordination. What are their role between the 3 roles? and it's okay for buyer and
  seller to register themselves using the same form and the sellers will be verified, what about the super admin? who can control everything -- is that
  supposed to be LMGa employee? I would like to understand the flow better


• Here’s how the roles line up and how LMGa fits into the picture:

  ### Roles in the current build

  1. Buyer (default app signup)
      - Typical client contact: site manager, procurement officer.
      - Can browse the catalogue, create orders, add items, and generate payment requests.
      - Sees only their own orders and payments.
  2. Seller Admin (register via same form, choose role)
      - Represents a supplier partner (possibly an LMGa business unit or a vetted third-party vendor).
      - After registering, must create their seller profile (/seller) to publish inventory.
      - Once a seller profile exists, they can add products (/products/new), edit or delete them, and monitor stock.
  3. Seller Staff
      - Similar to seller admin but assumes the seller profile already exists (created by a seller admin).
      - Can maintain catalogue entries and fulfil orders but may have limited authority depending on how you extend the permissions.
  4. Ops Admin
      - Think of this as an LMGa internal role. Currently it inherits seller privileges, but you can expand it to include oversight tasks (view all orders,
        approve seller accounts, manage payments, etc.).
  5. Superuser (Django admin user)
      - Your actual “full control” back-office account—intended for LMGa employees who manage the system itself.
      - Created via python manage.py createsuperuser .... They can log into the Django admin to review all data, manage users, approve or deactivate sellers,
        trigger manual migrations, etc.
      - They can also impersonate other roles by changing the role field on user records if needed.

  ### LMGa’s role across the three personas

  - Buyer: LMGa plays the coordinating partner—ensuring materials are real, stock levels meaningful, and logistics execution (delivery windows, cross-docking,
    QA samples).
  - Seller Admin/Staff: In many cases these would be LMGa business units (e.g., “LMGa Aggregates depot”) or vetted external suppliers managed under LMGa’s
    umbrella. LMGa verifies them (the verified flag) before their products appear live.
  - Ops Admin/Superuser: These are LMGa employees. They maintain the marketplace, approve new seller accounts, reconcile payments, and keep the catalogue
    clean.

  ### Signup/Verification flow

  - The public registration form is shared because buyers and seller partners alike might start digitally. The difference is the role they pick (buyers
    default to “buyer”; seller admins choose their role manually; ops admin accounts should be created internally).
  - Once a seller admin creates their seller profile, an ops admin/superuser can verify them by setting verified=True (or using an approval workflow you add).
    Until verified, you can hide their products from the public catalogue.
  - Superuser accounts are created internally and should not be exposed via self-service signup; they’re for LMGa staff only.

  ### Suggested future refinements

  - Distinguish more clearly between LMGa-managed sellers and external partners (perhaps a “pending verification” banner or blocking visibility until
    verified).
  - Add role-specific dashboards: e.g., buyer sees fulfilment timelines, seller sees pending orders, ops admin sees health metrics.
  - Introduce approval steps, e.g., new seller admins trigger an ops-admin review before they can publish.
  - Lock the “ops_admin” role to internal creation, similar to superuser.

  In summary: public users can pick buyer or seller during signup; LMGa (ops admin/superuser) sits on top to verify, enable, and coordinate. That’s what lets
  LMGa ensure the supply chain actually runs smoothly while buyers and seller partners get the tools they need.
