LMGa Construction Solutions: Project Overview
---------------------------------------------

What is this?
-------------
This project is a digital command centre for LMGa Construction Solutions. It helps
developers, project managers, and procurement teams find the construction materials
and certified workforce they need, then place, track, and reconcile orders from one
place.

Key things it can do:
---------------------
1. Product catalogue
   • Browse building materials already vetted by LMGa
   • See live stock levels, typical pricing, and brand information
   • Request more details or start an order with one click

2. Project-friendly ordering
   • Create an order for a specific material straight from its page
   • Add items, choose delivery options (pickup or scheduled drop-off), and see totals
   • Generate mobile money payment requests and confirm them via webhook simulation

3. Role-based experience
   • Buyers see a streamlined flow for sourcing and placing orders
   • Seller administrators manage their business profile, publish new products, keep inventory
     up to date, and invite their own staff members into the platform
   • Operation teams can review orders, payments, and webhook payloads for testing

4. Logistics awareness
   • Highlights include quality assurance badges, delivery coverage, and compliance notes
   • The system makes it clear that LMGa handles tracking, testing, and coordination

How it’s presented:
-------------------
• Modern website with both light and dark themes
• Supports English and Swahili, switchable from the header menu
• Mobile-responsive so site managers and buyers can use it on the go
• Landing page tells the brand story, showcases service pillars, and links to the live catalogue

Why it matters:
---------------
The aim is to reduce friction in the construction supply chain. Instead of juggling calls,
spreadsheets, and emails, LMGa clients can see available stock, immediately place orders,
and loop in LMGa logistics and finance teams—all from one unified interface. It’s built
to inspire confidence, speed up decision-making, and keep large building projects on time.
